## Fake-Currency-Detection-using-AI-ML

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the authenticity of banknotes. The model uses features such as variance, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy of wavelet-transformed images of the banknotes. The target value is 0 for real banknotes and 1 for fake banknotes.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Banknote Authentication Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 1,372 instances of banknotes, each with five numeric input variables and one binary target variable.

#Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.7 or higher
Scikit-learn
